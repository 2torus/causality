Tools for causal analysis

Nonparametric contains a tool for non-parametrically estimating a causal distribution from an observational data set. You can supply an "admissable set" of variables for controlling, and the measure either the causal effect distribution of an effect given the cause, or the expected value of the effect given the cause.

This repository is in its early phases, and the tests don't yet all pass.  The run-time for the tests is also long.  Many optimizations will be made over the course of the coming weeks.
